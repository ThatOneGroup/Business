    <p>My name is Landon, and I started an entertainment company. Where the artist, and everyone who is included in the process of creating is appreciated. Not only is this a company for entertainment, but for many other things that will be made in the future. While internet fame is good, and all I'm in it for he smiles that it can bring people. As well to see people with bad days have good days instead. The motto I live by is "Live THe Hype Everyday". Similar to live life to the fullest, it came to me when I lost many people in the few years of highschool. I decided that living the day to the fullest, and making sure that any negativity isn't slowing me or anyone around me down. Negativity is what keeps us from doing what we want. I don't want people to feel negative, and decide that doing nothing that day is the best option. I want people to see that life is what you make it, and the negativity isn't worth focusing on.</p><br>
    <p>Usually at the end of vlogs (video blogs) I say "The hype got me shook", in some form. It means that even though that day wasn't much, I still pushed it to the fullest. Some days I don't feel like doing anything, and I still get up to go do something. To live to the fullest it doesn't have to be something new everyday. It just needs to be something that you enjoy doing. Never let negativity get in the way of something you enjoy doing.</p><br>
    <p>While I don't really upload as much as I want to. I always choose to use the best content that I can make, that I know people will enjoy. While I do music, still yet to release the official album of JustOne. I found that the old version that I was going to release wasn't what I wanted to publish. I found that I want my music to be relatable for the listeners. I find that most music now days is just about sex, and I don't understand why that's all people use music for. I want to be an artist that is different from that. Most hip-hop artist now write songs that are either about sex, or violence. All which don't define the artist as who they really are. Music is about the soul, and who the person is on the inside.</p><br>
    <p>The people that I want to work with, will be artist who can be relatable. I want them to actually thank their fans every now and then. The fans are the reason why we can do what we do. Most money that I make now goes into charity, because it feels right. I love to help others, and that is what this company is for. To help aspiring artist finally get their big break. Give them a stable job that can help them grow as a person, and an artist. Many people who are artist, don't get recognized for the skill that they have. I want the world to realize that art isn't just a hobby, for many it's a way of life. This way of life is not easy, but it is the passion that drives us to continue doing what we love. I am LPNeil, and this is my life.</p><br>
