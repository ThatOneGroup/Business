    <p>My name is Landon, and I started an entertainment company. Where the artist, and everyone who is included in the process of creating is appreciated. Not only is this a company for entertainment, but for many other things that will be made in the future. While internet fame is good, and all I'm in it for he smiles that it can bring people. As well to see people with bad days have good days instead. The motto I live by is "Live THe Hype Everyday". Similar to live life to the fullest, it came to me when I lost many people in the few years of highschool. I decided that living the day to the fullest, and making sure that any negativity isn't slowing me or anyone around me down. Negativity is what keeps us from doing what we want. I don't want people to feel negative, and decide that doing nothing that day is the best option. I want people to see that life is what you make it, and the negativity isn't worth focusing on.</p><br>
    <p>Usually at the end of vlogs (video blogs) I say "The hype got me shook", in some form. It means that even though that day wasn't much, I still pushed it to the fullest. Some days I don't feel like doing anything, and I still get up to go do something. To live to the fullest it doesn't have to be something new everyday. It just needs to be something that you enjoy doing.</p><br>
